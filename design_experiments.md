# Designing Experiments

Variables: POS, Source Concept, Target Concept, Concept Mapping, Metaphor
Types: Sarcasm, Satire, Irony
Dataset: 
playing_$$PoS[VBG]Target[use|UTILITY]Source[play|ACTION]$$ 

metaphor: playing
POS: VBG
Target Concept: UTILITY
Source Concept: ACTION
Concept Mapping: UTILITY IS ACTION (target is source)

1. Statistical Analysis
#POS, #Source, #Target, #Metaphor, #Unique Concept Mappings

2. Common Concept Mappings across all
(a) "heatmap of same concept mappings" across all types
(b) Concept Mapping Frequency Statistics -> concept mappings

3. Different Concept Mappings across all
Defination: concept mappings more significant in one type but not in the other type
